📊 YouTube Data Engineering Project:

🚀 Overview

This project focuses on building a scalable, cloud-based data engineering pipeline to ingest, process, store, and analyze structured and semi-structured YouTube trending videos data. The goal is to understand video categories, engagement metrics, and trending patterns using a modern AWS data stack.

🎯 Project Objectives

Data Ingestion – Collect data from multiple sources into a unified workflow.

ETL Pipeline – Transform raw datasets into clean, analysis-ready formats.

Data Lake Architecture – Store all raw & processed data in a centralized repository.

Scalability – Ensure smooth handling of large and ever-growing datasets.

Cloud Integration – Leverage AWS services for cost-efficient large-scale processing.

Reporting & Insights – Build dashboards to answer key business questions.

🧰 AWS Services Used

Amazon S3 – Serves as the main data lake for raw & processed files.

AWS IAM – Manages secure access throughout the pipeline.

AWS Glue – Automates data discovery, cataloging, and ETL.

AWS Lambda – Executes serverless transformations & triggers.

Amazon Athena – Runs SQL queries directly on S3 without loading data.

Amazon QuickSight – Builds interactive dashboards & visual insights.

📂 Dataset
